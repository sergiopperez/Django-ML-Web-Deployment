# ML-based web application employing Django

The code is based on the post https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-a-machine-learning-based-web-application-using-django-5444e0053a09

The employed dataset is the popular Titanic dataset, where we predict the survival of passengers depending on different attributes.

The model is then deployed in a web application by means of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

This is the home page of the web application:
